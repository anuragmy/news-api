# Newsio

A news application built using ReactJS (Reusable Components) and [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) that helps list and preview news articles from various sources as well as display latest and trending news on the home page. Get up-to-date breaking news and articles from news sources and blogs all over the web.
You will need an API key from https://newsapi.org.
Please look at their [documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs) to see how to use the API.  
Alternatively you can also use: https://mediastack.com/ - Free, Simple REST API for Live News & Blog Articles

Once you have the API, goto 'src/api/index.js' and paste your API key.
